oxidation,0,0,0.25,-0.25,-0.5,0.5,-1,1,0,50,100,photosynthetic water oxidation; donor/acceptor written as 4e- transfer. Z-scheme usually written as making 3 ATP per O2 => 0.75 ATP/e-. Using 1 for simplicity
reduction,1,-1,0,0,2,-2,3,-3,0,50,100,need 4e- to go from +4 to ZC=0. CBB cycle uses 3 ATP/C. 
anabolism,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0.3,-0.3,1,50,100,"anabolism from glucose, assume biomass redox ≈ 0 = glucose as a baseline. Biomass is in units of C atoms"
ATP_homeostasis,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,50,100,not the same as cyclic electron flow -- sign matter
redox_homeostasis,0,0,0.25,-0.25,-0.5,0.5,-1,1,0,50,100,"can burn off extra reductant for balancing, get a little ATP from doing so?"
