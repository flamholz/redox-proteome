# Data from chemostat growth

Data mostly used to plot respiratory rates as a function of dilution.

E. coli data from the Kayser et al. was extracted from table 1. Yeast data from Postman et al. was extracted from Figure 2 with WebPlotDigitizer. Extracted data was rounded to 2 significant figures.
